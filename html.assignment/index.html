    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> My name is Kimberly World. This is my first assignment being pushed into Github. I am taking Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College and this is my first year in the program. I will be graduating in the spring of 2023. I am excited to learn various aspects of media design and continue to learn about multi aspects that can future my career in my field. Here is an image a made in my graphics design class last semester.

    <p>Learning during the pandemic has been <em>quite</em> difficult. However I found the transition between virtual to in person to be a challenege too. But during this time, I have learned a lot about my learning style at <abbr title="Algonquin College"> A.C</abbr>. Most importantly, not drink too much H<sup>2</sup>0 while I am in class because the restroom isnt 2min down my bedroom hall anymore.
