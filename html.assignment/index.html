    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> My name is Kimberly World. This is my first assignment being pushed into github. I am taking Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. This is my first year in the program and I will be graduating in the spring of 2023. I am excited to learn various aspects of media design and continue to learn about multi aspects that can future my career in my field.
    </p>
    <p>Learning during the pandemic</p> has been <em>quite</em>difficult. However I found the tradition between virtual to in person to be a challenege too.
